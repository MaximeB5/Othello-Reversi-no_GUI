# Othello Reversi [no GUI]

## What is it ? ##
* A shell version of the Othello game (also known under the name Reversi).
* For 2 players

## Version of the game ##
The current version of the game is 1.0.

## OS Supported ##
Target OS : Windows (only for the refresh of the shell -> this is implemented in main.cpp with the two functions "void Setup_Windows_Terminal(void);" and "void Clear_Windows_Terminal_Screen(char fill = ' ');").

## Why is there no GUI and why is it Windows only ? ##
```
First of all, the purpose of this project was to be no GUI at all.
Another project with a GUI is on the track, the repository will be Othello Reversi with GUI.

It is Windows only because I did not want to be bothered with cross-platform for this project.
The GUI repository will be cross-platform, so don't worry !
```

## TODO List ##
* Add an IA bot player
* Maybe finish the display result function in main.cpp, I don't remember if I finished it for the pawns counter.
* Create the GUI project
